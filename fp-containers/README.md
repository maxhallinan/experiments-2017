# fp-containers

Functional programming with composable container types.


## Notes


### `Box`

[./box.js](./box.js)

- Box can also be called Container or the Identity functor.
- Box is a Functor.
    - A Functor is a type that implements `map` and obeys some laws.
    - Functor could also be called Mappable.
- Enables composing transformations of that value without storing intermediate values.

### `Maybe`

[./maybe.js](./maybe.js)

- A container type that handles possible `null` value.


### `Either`

[./either.js](./either.js)

- `Either` is a type that returns one of two subtypes: `Right` or `Left`.
- `Either` tests `x`. If the test succeeds, it returns `Right x` and if it fails, 
  it returns `Left x`.
- `Right` and `Left` have the same methods but these methods behave differently.
- `Right.map` and `Left.map` both take `fn`, but `Left.map` will not call `fn`.
- `Right.fold` and `Left.fold` both take `f, g`. `Right.fold` calls `g(x)` and
  `Left.fold` calls `f(x)`.
- This interface allows things like handling unexpected or invalid values without
  risking throwing an error.

## Semi-groups

[./semi-groups.js](./semi-groups.js)

- Semi-groups are used for combining things.
- A Semi-group is a type with a `concat` method.
  - `String` and `Array` are both semi-groups
- `concat` is associative: the result of the combination is the same no matter
  how the operation is grouped.
  - ex: 1 + (1 + 1) = (1 + 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1


#### Monoids

- A semi-group that contains a special neutral element acting like `identity`.
- A semi-group type has a method like `empty` that returns that neutral element.
- The value of the neutral element is that it provides a baseline for safe operation.

### `IO`

[./io.js](./io.js)

- Impure functions become 'pure' when they are wrapped in a function.

```
const impureGetLocalStorage = (k) => localStorage.getItem(k);

// given the same input `k` always gets the same output, a function that applies
// `k` to `impureGetLocalStorage`.
const pureGetLocalStorage = (k) => () => impureGetLocalStorage(k);
```

- `IO` delays an impure action by capturing it in a function wrapper.
- Reason about the value contained by `IO` as the wrapped value and not the 
  wrapper, even though strictly speaking the value contained by `IO` is always a
  function.

### Laws of Functors

- A function has a `map` method.
- A functor obeys some laws:
  - `map` preserves function composition: 
    `fx.map(x => f(x)).map(x => g(x)) === fx.map(x => g(f(x)))`.
  - `const identity = x => x; fx.map(identity) === identity(fx)`.
