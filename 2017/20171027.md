## Elm questions

### _How to organize code in a non-trivial application: where do the decoders go?_


This is how Richard Feldman structures `rtfeldman/elm-spa-example`:

```
Data/
Page/
Request/
Views/
Main.elm
Ports.elm
Route.elm
Util.elm
```

**`Page.*`**: logic specific to pages of the application. e.g., `Page.Home`,
`Page.Articles`, `Page.Article.Editor`. Pages dependent on remote data expose an
`init` function that returns a `Task` responsible for loading the data.

**`Views.*`**: logic that is used by more than one `Page.*` module. `Views.Page`
exposes a `frame` function that wraps each page in a header and footer.

**`Data.*`**: describe domain-specific data structures. Expose functions for
transforming those data structures, including decoders that serialize/deserialize.
Identifiers like `id` and `slug` are described as union types, e.g. `ArticleSlug String`
or `UserId Int`.

**`Request.*`**: Expose functions to make API requests to the server. API endpoint
strings are only used in these modules.

**`Route.elm`**: All of the routing logic.

**`Ports.elm`** All of the ports logic.

**`Util.elm`** (or `Misc.elm`) holds various utility functions.

### _Are the functions exposed by the Elm JavaScript object documented anywhere?_

I've been able to find bits of documentation in various places.

- [Elm Guide: `Elm.[module name].fullscreen`](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html#step-1-embed-in-html#ports)
- [Elm Guide: `Elm.[module name].embed`](https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html#step-1-embed-in-html)
- [elm-lang/core documentation: `Elm.[module name].worker`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform)

### _Is there a better way to debug JSON decoding than logging the error in the
update function?_


### _What is the Elm strategy for debugging?_
