## Redux store enhancers

The Redux `createStore` helper function takes an `enhancer` as an optional last 
argument.

The `enhancer` is a store enhancer.

Store enhancers are a way to add behavior to the store.

A store enhancer has this signature:

```
type StoreEnhancer = (next: StoreCreator) => StoreCreator
```

A `StoreCreator` has this signature:

```
type StoreCreator = (reducer: Reducer, preloadedState: ?State) => Store
```

Note that this is not exactly the same signature as that of `createStore` because
`createStore` takes an `enhancer` argument.

Here's a basic `StoreEnhancer` implementation:

```javascript
const storeEnhancer = 
// `next` is a `StoreCreator`
(next) => 
  // `storeEnhancer` returns a `StoreCreator`
  (reducer, preloadedState) => {
    const store = next(reducer, preloadedState);

    // returns a `Store`
    return ({
      ...store,  
      // Here is where we have the opportunity to add behavior to the store
      // by wrapping the store interface.
      getState: () => {
        // Do some stuff that the Redux store does not do by default.
        console.log('Hello World!');

        return store.getState();
      },
    })
  };
```

### `zelektree`

Implementation sketch:

```javascript
import { createStore, } from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducers';
import $visibleFoos from './selectors/visible-foos'

const getDerivedStateFactory = (selectors) => {
  const selectorPairs = toPairs(selectors);

  // validate selectors here?

  const getDerivedState = (state) =>
    selectorPairs.reduce((derivedState, [ key, selector, ]) => ({
      ...derivedState,
      [key]: selector(state),
    }), {});

  return getDerivedState;
};

const embedSelectors = (selectors) => {
  if (typeOf(selectors) !== 'object') {
    throw new TypeError(`Expected selectors to be an object.`)
  }

  const getDerivedState = getDerivedStateFactory(selectors);

  return (next) => {
    return (reducer, preloadedState, enhancer) => {
      const store = next(reducer, preloadedState, enhancer);
      const state = store.getState();

      return ({
        ...store,
        getState: () => ({
          ...state,
          ...getDerivedState(state),
        }),
      });
    };
  };
};

const selectors = {
  visibleFoos: $visibleFoos,
};

const createStore(
  reducer,
  embedSelectors(selectors)
);
```

## Questions

Questions I have about `zelektree`:

- What is the effect on performance?
- Will selector values show up in the redux dev tools?
- What happens when you serialize the state?
- What happens when you preload state that collides with the selector keys?
- What about non-plain values like Maybe's or functions?
