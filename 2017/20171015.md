## Redux store enhancers

The Redux `createStore` helper function takes an `enhancer` as an optional last 
argument.

The `enhancer` is a store enhancer.

Store enhancers are a way to add behavior to the store.

A store enhancer has this signature:

```
type StoreEnhancer = (next: StoreCreator) => StoreCreator
```

A `StoreCreator` has this signature:

```
type StoreCreator = (reducer: Reducer, preloadedState: ?State) => Store
```

Note that this is not exactly the same signature as that of `createStore` because
`createStore` takes an `enhancer` argument.

Here's a basic `StoreEnhancer` implementation:

```javascript
const storeEnhancer = 
// `next` is a `StoreCreator`
(next) => 
  // `storeEnhancer` returns a `StoreCreator`
  (reducer, preloadedState) => {
    const store = next(reducer, preloadedState);

    // returns a `Store`
    return ({
      ...store,  
      // Here is where we have the opportunity to add behavior to the store
      // by wrapping the store interface.
      getState: () => {
        // Do some stuff that the Redux store does not do by default.
        console.log('Hello World!');

        return store.getState();
      },
    })
  };
```
