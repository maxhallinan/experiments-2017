## More sketches for a generative text grammar language

Can inject data into the grammar in the form of a JSON blob.
This data is referenced by `$key`.
The resulting function takes an arbitrary JSON blob of arrays of terminal symbols:
`"{ \"key\": [ \"terminal\" ] }"`.

Helper functions include:
- `titlecase`: titlecase words in a terminal symbol.
- `uppercase`: uppercase all characters in a terminal symbol.
- `lowercase`: lowercase all characters in a terminal symbol.
- `pluralize`: pluralize a terminal symbol.
- `singularize`: singularize a terminal symbol.
- `join`: 
- Something for articles.
- Something for verb tense.

Some way of parameterizing nonterminal symbols.

Some way to avoid reusing a terminal symbol within a certain context.

Placing two nonterminal symbols next to each other has the effect of concatenating them.

It seems like loops would be helpful.

Loops and parameterized fragments.

Vocabulary:

- fragment: a production rule
