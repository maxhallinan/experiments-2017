_Is Dominoh a context-free language?_

`::Foo bar baz:: $foo $#bar`

```
fragment -> block, text, block, { tag }
block -> "::"
tag -> symbol , identifier
symbol -> text | text, symbol
identifier -> text 
```

Dominoh is not a context-free language. What makes the language not context-sensitive
is that symbols at the end of fragments are ambiguous. The only way you can
distinguish a symbol at the end of a fragment is by first parsing all of the
`:::` blocks. So I guess there would be two parsing passes?

I believe adding a `MetaBlock` (`:::`) to the end of the `SymbolList`
makes Dominoh context-free:

Edit: no, that's wrong. It's still not context free because a fragment can be
with/without a symbol list and the only way to know if there's a symbol list
is to advance arbitrarily foward until the `:::` end is found. At which point,
it's ambiguous whether that's the end of a symbol list or the beginning of a 
new meta block.
