Syntax sketches for dominoh:

```
::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
|$Benkler, [1], networked information economy, Yochai Benkler|

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
{$Benkler, [1], networked information economy, Yochai Benkler}

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
($Benkler, [1], networked information economy, Yochai Benkler)

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
[$Benkler, (1), networked information economy, Yochai Benkler]

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
<$Benkler, [1], networked information economy, Yochai Benkler>
```

```
::Information is both input and output of its own production process.
::$benkler, (1), #econ, #benkler::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
::$benkler, [1], networked information economy, Yochai Benkler::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
::$benkler, @1, networked information economy, Yochai Benkler::
```

One idea is to have the language be a set of nonterminal symbols that are 
replaced with terminal symbols.

In this idea, you lose the semantics of the subtext.

Not sure how useful it is to associates a list of subtexts with a text.

```
:::
$ : sources
# : tags

benkler > Yochai Benkler
econ    > networked information economy
title   > The Wealth of Networks
:::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
::$#benkler $#title #econ::
```

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Information is both input and output of its own production process.",
    "subtexts": {
      "sources": [
        "Yochai Benkler",
        "The Wealth of Networks"
      ],
      "tags": [
        "Yochai Benkler",
        "The Wealth of Networks"
        "networked information economy"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```
