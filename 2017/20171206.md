## State Machines for Event-Driven Systems

[State Machines for Event-Driven Systems](https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/State-Machines-Event-Driven-Systems)

Most computers are event-driven systems.
The system waits for an event and then reacts to an event when one is produced.
This implies that only a fraction of the code is executed at one time.
The primary task is to run the right code path.
Events arrive in an unpredictable order.
Code path can differ each time the code is run.
Reactive system has no progression from beginning to end.
A reactive system continues to react to events until the system is shut down.
A GUI is a event-driven system.

>The main challenge in programming reactive systems is to identify the appropriate
>actions to execute in reaction to a given event.

>The actions are determined by two factors: by the nature of the event and by the
>current context.

The `RemoteData` pattern describes the lifecycle of an HTTP request.
HTTP is a stateless protocol.
But cached data is inherently stateful. 
`RemoteData` represents the nature of the event but it does not represent the 
context.

>A state machine makes the event handling explicitly dependent on both the nature
>of the event and on the context (`state`) of the systme.

State machines require an execution context (thread) and an event-dispatching
mechanism.

Implementation approaches to state machines:

- Nested `switch` statement with a `state` variable that represents the 
  discriminator on one level and the event-type in the other.
- A state table containing an array of transitions for each state. The table
  lists event types along one dimension and state types along the other. Each
  "cell" on the table is a reference to a state transition.
- A tree structure that is traversed at runtime by a state machine interpreter.


```elm
type Signal 
  = Foo

type alias Event = 
  { signal : Signal 
  }

type State
  = Bar

type alias StateMachine = 
  { state : State
  }

init : State -> StateMachine
init s =
  StateMachine s
  
dispatch : Event -> 
dispatch e = 
  
transition : Event -> 
transition =
```

```elm
type Event 
  = Request
  | Success a
  | Error a

type State
  = Empty
  | Pending
  | CachedValid
  | CachedInvalid
```

## Functional state machine implementations 

[Building a Primitive State Machine in Haskell](http://daniel-levin.github.io/2015/01/19/primitive-state-machine-in-haskell.html)

The basic approach to maintaining state is to use recursion and to "set" the
next state by passing it to the next recursive call.

Here is the article describe above in Elm:

```elm
type State
    = S0
    | S1
    | S2


accepts : State -> String -> Bool
accepts state s =
    case String.uncons s of
        Just ( head, tail ) ->
            case state of
                S0 ->
                    case head of
                        'a' ->
                            accepts S1 tail

                        'b' ->
                            accepts S2 tail

                        _ ->
                            False

                S1 ->
                    case head of
                        'a' ->
                            accepts S2 tail

                        'b' ->
                            accepts S0 tail

                        _ ->
                            False

                S2 ->
                    case head of
                        'a' ->
                            accepts S0 tail

                        'b' ->
                            accepts S2 tail

                        _ ->
                            False

        Nothing ->
            case state of
                S2 ->
                    True

                _ ->
                    False


decide : String -> Bool
decide =
    accepts S0


a : Bool
a =
    Debug.log "False" <| decide "aaa"


b : Bool
b =
    Debug.log "True" <| decide "aaaabbaaa"


c : Bool
c =
    Debug.log "False" <| decide "babababa"
```

Do finite state machines help to solve the remote data problem?

```elm
{-
   The states of a RemoteData cache

   no data cached
   no data cached, request pending
   no data cached, request error for collection
   data cached
   data cached, request pending for collection
   data cached, request pending for item
   data cached, request error for collection
   data cached, request error for item in collection

   Empty
   EmptyPendingItem
   EmptyPendingCollection
   EmptyErrorItem
   EmptyErrorCollection
   Cached
   CachedPendingItem
   CachedPendingCollection
   CachedErrorItem
   CachedErrorCollection
-}


type Health
    = Pending
    | Valid
    | Invalid


type Source
    = Collection
    | Item Int


type Event
    = Request Source
    | Success a
    | Error e



-- type State
--     = EmptyValid -- no error, no data
--     | EmptyPendingItem
--     | EmptyPendingCollection
--     | EmptyErrorItems (List ItemError) -- error, id
--     | EmptyErrorCollection a -- error
--     | CachedValid d -- data
--     | CachedPendingItem d -- data
--     | CachedPendingCollection d -- data
--     | CachedErrorItems (List ItemError) d -- error, id, data
--     | CachedErrorCollection e d -- error, data


type State
    = Init
    | Empty ( Health, Source )
    | Cached ( Health, Source ) a


transition : Action -> State -> State
transition action state =
    case state of
        Empty ( Pending, Item _ ) ->
            case action of
                Request Item id ->
                    Empty ( Pending, Item id )

                Request Collection ->
                    Empty ( Pending, Collection )

                Success data ->
                    Cached ( Valid, Item id ) data

                Error error ->
                    Empty ( Invalid error, Item id )

        Empty ( Pending, Collection ) ->
            case action of
                Request Item id ->
                    Empty ( Pending, Item id )

                Request Collection ->
                    state

                Success data ->
                    Cached ( Valid, Collection ) data

                Error error ->
                    Empty ( Invalid error, Collection )

        Empty ( Invalid err, Item id ) ->
            False

        Empty ( Invalid err, Collection ) ->
            False

        Cached ( Pending, Item id ) ->
            False

        Cached ( Pending, Collection _ ) ->
            False

        Cached ( Invalid err, Item id ) ->
            False

        Cached ( Invalid err, Collection xs ) ->
            False
```
