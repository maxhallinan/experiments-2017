### Compiler extras

These are some extra features the compiler could provide but which aren't part
of the core specification. I don't know if they should be part of the specification
or not.

#### Location

```json
[
  {
    "location": {
      "clean": {
        "start": {
          "line": 2,
          "char": 1
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 2,
          "char": 72 
        }
      },
      "source": {
        "start": {
          "line": 9,
          "char": 3
        },
        "end": {
          "line": 9,
          "char": 75 
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

## Elm culture

Evan gets mad when questioned:

>I am aware that you feel differently Peter. 
>You let me know on every public post I make. 
>Saying it more times does not make it a more persuasive argument. 
>To me it feels like you are trying to use public pressure to force me to revisit 
>prioritization decisions that I have documented.

Culture of apologizing for raising legitimate questions:

>    You let me know on every public post I make. Saying it more times does not make it a more persuasive argument.
>
>I apologize. I know I have expressed my disagreement on certain topics before but I was not aware that I did it this often.
>
>    your behavior in particular makes me question if I should say anything at all.
>
>Again, I apologize. Last thing I want is to hurt Elm in any way.
