## Questions

_How to do multiple subscriptions?_

(`Sub.batch`)[http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Platform-Sub#batch]
takes a list of subscriptions and returns a single subscription.

```elm
batch : List (Sub msg) -> Sub msg
```

_What's the difference between an Array and a List?_

[Stack Overflow: Array vs List in Elm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37707577/array-vs-list-in-elm)

**List**

`List` has an `O(n)` lookup time based on index. `List` is faster for folding and
mapping, and slower for lookup by index.

**Array**

`Array` has an `O(log n)` loopup time based on index. `Array` is slower for folding
and mapping, and faster for lookup by index.


_Why can't you append to a List without concating a singleton array?_

Prepending is faster than appending. With prepending, you simply take the new
element and point to the first item in the list. With appending, you have to 
traverse the entire list until you find the last item, and then add a pointer
on the last item to the newly added item. The difference is `O(1)` versus `O(n)`.

_Is the record destructuring syntax documented anywhere?_


_How would I make a clock that you can stop and then start again from the time it
was stopped? The elm guide clock example will skip the clock hand forward after it's
restarted._

## Hosting a static site on S3 and CloudFront

Steps I took:

- Created an S3 bucket.
- Named the bucket "maxhallinan.com" (after the site domain).
- Set the permissions to public.
- Built the Jekyll site locally.


```shell
s3cmd put --acl-public --no-preserve --exclude ".DS_Store" --exclude "*.*" --add-header="Cache-Control:public, max-age=#{oneweek}" --add-header="Content-Encoding:gzip"  --mime-type="text/css" --include "*.css" _site/static/css/* s3://maxhallinan.com/static/css/ -c /home/max/.s3cmd/maxhallinan.com
```
