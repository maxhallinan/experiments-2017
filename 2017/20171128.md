## Difference between `.chain` and `.map`

You have a value wrapped up in a type and you want to compose functions that 
transform that value.
These functions can have different type signatures.
Some return `M a` and others just return `a`.
Composition is the key to understanding the difference between `chain` and `map`.
`chain` or `flatMap` or whatever isn't a mystical operator, it's just a way to 
compose a certain kind of transformation with some other different kinds of 
transformations.
