## Grammar for a procedurally generated narrative

Here are is the grammar.

```
[person]
Friendly Skull
Pipes
Donovan Roundness
Vernerd
Weepy Weepy

[thing]
spell
comb
rolled pants
the last lightbulb
both wool slippers

[utility]
smashing concrete
spellchecking foggy thoughts
scalp scratching
smashing concrete
paying the price
finding electrocution risks

[place]
the begrudging office of [person]
[person]'s enviable reading chair

[start]
[person] lost [thing] for [utility] in [place].
```

Other ideas:

```
[things]
a spell for spellchecking foggy thoughts
a comb for scalp scratching
rolled pants revealing short socks
the last lightbulb smashed by concrete
wool slippers that were worth the price
a possible electrocution risk
```

Next steps:

- Write a program which generates the strings that this grammar can generate.
- Which language should I write this in?

Things that would be useful for a language for procedural generation of text:

- Pluralization
- Capitalization
- Correct article
- Correct pronoun
- Be able to wrap a nonterminal symbol in context. e.g., if '[person] is [person]'
  is the nonterminal, then I can say that in both cases `[person]` is `'foo'`.
  This would make it non-context free I believe.
