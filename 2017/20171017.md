Is this better than React's array syntax for DOM fragments?

This:

```javascript
import Foo from './Foo';

const Foos = () => ([
  <Foo />,
  <Foo />,
  <Foo />,
]);
```

becomes:

```javascript
import { Fragment, } from 'fuhragment';
import Foo from './Foo';

const Foos = () => (
  <Fragment>
    <Foo />
    <Foo />
    <Foo />
  </Fragment>
);
```

I find the trailing commas in the above a little annoying.
