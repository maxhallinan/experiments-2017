Annotation layer:

- Client: enables you to read and create annotations
- Hosting: the annotations are stored on a P2P network
- Registry: append-only log that associates annotations with a Dat address.
    - Annotations can annotate other annotations.

**Questions**

- What about moderation?
  - Use a cryptocurrency to deter spam
- How does one create a registry that everyone can write to?
  - Use a blockchain as the registry
  - Would it be possible to do something like this on Dat?
  - Discoverability is hard
