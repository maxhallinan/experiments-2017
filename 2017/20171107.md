## Dominoh syntax

Dominoh is a lightweight markup language for annotating text. 
Annotations are associations between a fragment of text and one or more subtexts. 
User-defined symbols mark semantic relationships between a text fragment and 
each of its subtexts.

The goal of the Dominoh project is to provide a human-writable way to embed
structured data in an unstructured document without making assumptions about the 
nature of the structure/relationships/etc.

Dominoh can be used for something as simple as "highlighting" parts of a document. 

The goal of the Dominoh is to provide an extensible syntax for explicitly
describing structured relationships that are implicit in an unstructured document.
A simple use case is highlighting bits of text in an plain text notetaking file.

### Basic

```
::Information is both input and output of its own production process.::
```

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Information is both input and output of its own production process.",
    "subtexts": {}
  }
]
```

### Subtext

```
:::
$ : sources
# : tags

benkler      , Yochai Benkler
network_econ , networked information economy
:::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.:: $benkler
```

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Information is both input and output of its own production process.",
    "subtexts": {
      "sources": [
        "Yochai Benkler"
      ],
      "tags": [
        "networked information economy"
      ]
      "foo": []
    }
  }
]
```


### Compound symbols

```
:::
$ : sources
# : tags

benkler      , Yochai Benkler
network_econ , networked information economy
:::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.:: $#benkler #network_econ
```

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Information is both input and output of its own production process.",
    "subtexts": {
      "sources": [
        "Yochai Benkler"
      ],
      "tags": [
        "Yochai Benkler",
        "networked information economy"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

```
:::
$ , sources
# , tags
:::

::::
benkler      , Yochai Benkler
network_econ , networked information economy
::::

::Information is both input and output of its own production process.:: $#benkler #network_econ
```

```json
[
  {
    "text": "Information is both input and output of its own production process.",
    "subtexts": {
      "sources": [
        "Yochai Benkler"
      ],
      "tags": [
        "Yochai Benkler",
        "networked information economy"
      ]
    }
  }
