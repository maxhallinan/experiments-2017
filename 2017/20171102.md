## Tracery

Tracery features:

- Random output: `grammar.flatten('ruleName')` returns one possible branch, 
  randomly selected.
- Nonterminal symbols: `#foo#`.
- Infinitely extensible. 
  Can hold as many "rules" as you want. 
  Can "flatten" any of these rules. 
  So any nonterminal symbol can be treated as a start symbol.
- Nonterminal symbols are recursive.
  - Requires a base case, otherwise Tracery gets stuck in infinite recursion.
- Nonterminal symbols have modifiers:
  - `.s`: append 's' to the terminal symbol.
  - `.ed`: append 'ed' to the terminal symbol.
  - `.capitalize`: capitalize the terminal symbol.
  - `.capitalizeAll`: uppercase the terminal symbol.
  - `.a`: prepend 'a' or 'an' to the terminal symbol.
- Actions are a way to "save information": `#[alias:#nonterminal2#]nonterminal1#`. 
  This feature enables you to replace a nonterminal symbol with a terminal symbol, 
  alias that terminal symbol, and then use that alias as the replacement for all 
  nonterminal symbols of the same name. 
  Essentially a runtime variable. 
  Introduces an idea of scope or context to these production rules. 
  Useful because once you generate a character name, for instance, you want the 
  character name to be consistent throughout the production.
    - Composable 

Modifiers and actions separate Tracery from context-free grammars but also are 
very useful/necessary for fulfilling its purpose.
