>All around (the hemulen) there were people living slipshod and aimless lives, wherever he looked there was something to be put to rights... ---Tove Jansson, *Moominvalley in November*

[Hemulen.js](/hemulen) is a microframework for building forms with drag--and--drop file upload fields. Hemulen.js is focused on data: managing files that have been dropped on a field, associating additional data with those files, formatting the data, and sending the data (along with the rest of the form) to the server. The state of a Hemulen instance is changed in two ways: through a user action such as dropping a file on the drag--and--drop field or programmatically, via the Hemulen API. When the state changes, the drag--and--drop element or form element (depending on the change) emits a DOM event. The event object supplies relevant data that the application can render to provide user feedback, update the user interface, etc. In this way, Hemulen.js abstracts the common concern of all drag--and--drop applications (handling the data) without tethering the application to presentational or functional requirements.

But what is a hemulen? Hemulens are characters from the [*Moomin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomin) series of comics and books by [Tove Jansson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson). The hemulens are great reformers, single-minded about enforcing rules, and humorless in their desire for a well-ordered world.

The name "Hemulen.js" was inspired by a hemulen-like dysphoria I was feeling in my client work. I was part of a team building a large site. Many of the site's features are familiar tropes of web design, e.g. an image carousel. For each of these features, there is a refined and well-tested solution in the form of a plugin. But the complexity of the interaction design necessitated plugins that are highly customizable and well-encapsulated. This sort of plugin proved hard to find.

As the project progressed, I became more and more grumpy about plugins that make too many assumptions and offer too many features. These plugins violate the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of "small, sharp tools, each intended to do one thing well." Plugins that fail to meet this standard have proliferated in the universe of client-side code. These plugins, like all plugins, intend to make client-side coding easier. Even when they succeed, the ease afforded comes at a cost. That cost is the subjugation of the codebase to a quiet tyranny wherein the plugin dictates (either explicitly or in effect) aspects of document structure, page styles, and application architecture. Sometimes these dictates are small and easily managed; sometimes they are significant and have significant side-effects.

I believe that every codebase has an ideal form and that the life of the codebase should be a movement towards the manifestation of that ideal. A plugin's side-effects can (and often do) impede that evolution, warp that form, and degrade that life. In the worst case, a codebase completely loses the path of self-realization, wandering in whatever direction it is pointed by its tools and hoping not to be pushed in two different directions at once. In those cases, the life of the codebase becomes, as the hemulen said, "slipshod and aimless". 

Hemulen.js was written with a hemulen-like desire for an application free of messy side-effects. Hemulen.js was named to poke fun at my own hemulen-like self-seriousness.
